# dhtml-style-guide

This project is about trying to make sure the work from the aol.developer is not lost. Sadly both AOL and the style guide no longer exist. The content here is not my own (aol.developer's work) and copied from the web.archive with archival date 2013-01-27. If anyone has an issue with this feel free to contact me and I'll take this down. 

Over the years I found this a helpful reference and continue to this day. Much of the work here helped define behavior in the ARIA spec, especially the best practices section. Not much has changed since it was written.
